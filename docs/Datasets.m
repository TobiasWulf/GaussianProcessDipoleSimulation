%% Datasets
% Datasets are an appreciated way to save and reach done work and reuse it in
% progress. The easiest way to build and to use propper datasets in matlab are
% mat-files. They are easy to load and can be build by an script or function
% it just needs to save the variables from workspace. So latery save datasets
% can be used for futher calculations or to load certain configuration in to
% workspace and to solve task in a unified way.

%% TDK_TAS2141_Characterization_2019-07-24.mat
% The characterization dataset of the TDK TMR angular sensor as base dataset for
% sensor array dipol simulation. The dataset contains information about the
% stimulus wich was used for characterization, the magnetic resolustion or the
% sensor bridge outputs for Hx and Hy fields and bridge outputs corresponding to
% stimulus amplitudes in Hx and Hy direction.
%
%
%% config.mat
% Configuration dataset to control the main program from centralized config
% file. Includes any kind of configuration and parameters to load in function or
% script workspaces.
%
%
%% Training and Test Datasets
% Sensor array simulation datasets for training and test purpose for angle
% prediction via gaussian processes.
