    \begin{par}
A spherical magnet is assumed to be used for stimulation of the sensor array. The far field of a spherical magnet can be approximately described by the magnetic field of a magnetic dipole. The magnetization of the sphere is assumed to be in y direction and the magnetic moment in rest position for 0Â° points in x direction. The magnet must be defined in a way that its field lines or field strengths own gradients sufficiently strong enough in the distance to the sensor array and so the rotation of the magnet generates a small scattering of the bridge outputs in the individual sensor points in the array. That  all sensors in the array approximately perceive the same magnetic field gradients of the current rotation step and the sensors in the array run through approximately  equal circular paths in the characterization field. This means the sperical magnet is characterized by a favorable mating of sphere radius and a certain distance in rest position in which a sufficiently high field strength takes effect. Here are neglected small necessary distances which are demanded in standard automotive applications. The focus here is on to generate simulation datasets, which are uniform and valid for angle detection. The modelling of suitable small magnets is not taking place of the work.

A good working magnet is found emperical for H-field magnitudes of 200 kA/m and a distance from surface of 1 mm. See below figure of used magnet.

To change settings for simulation edit the config script and rerun it. To generate trainging and test data set use simulation script. It generates dataset for all position are known to TrainingOptions and TestOptions in config. Generate a set of dataset for one evaluation case. Evaluate datasets, save results for later clustering, edit config for next use case and rerun simulation.

The simulation bases on TDK TAS2141 "Rise" chracterization field. It has the widest linear plateau for corresponding Hx and Hy field strengths.
