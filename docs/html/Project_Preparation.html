%% Registrate Binaries to Git and Prepare Git Ignore Cases
% The root of Git is to work as text file versioner. Source code files are just
% text files. So git versionates, tags and merges them in various ways in work

% merges on file if they are not known  text files. To keep the versionating Git
% makes a taged copy of that file every time the file changed. That can be a
% very junk of memory and lets repository expands to wide.
%
% To prevent Git for misshandling binaries it is able to regestrate them in a
% certain file and mark the file types how to handle them in progress. The file
% is called .gitattributes must be placed in the Git assinged working directory
% which is the sandbox folder for Matlab projects. The .gitattributes file
% itself is hidden. 
%
% Three options are needed to mark a file type as binary. The -crlf option 
% disables end of line conversion and the -diff option in combination with the
% -merge option to mark the file as binary.
%
% In addition to that it is possible to delclare several ignore cases to Git. So

% From the sandbox directory enter in the Matlab command prompt edit
% .gittatributes and edit .gitignore and save both files. The files are not
% shown in Current Folder pane (hidden files). Edit both files in the Matlab
% editor and save the files.
%
% *Third step:*
%
% # Add common Matlab file types to .gitattributes.
% # Add Matlab compiler file types to .gitattributes.
% # Add other file types which can be appear during the work to .gitattributes.
% # Add ignore cases to .gitignore if needed.

%% Port Remote Repository to GitHub

% changes are made manually to the local repository.
%
% # According to new rules on GitHub the master branch is renamed to main.
