%% NXP KMZ60 Characterization
% NXP KMZ60 characterization as second base of the sensor array simulation was
% although done before and was manually modified to same structure as TDK
% dataset. With additional values for bridge gain. TDK dataset is adjusted in
% the same way now. The raw dataset was aquirred after the method Thorben Schüthe
% describe in his IEEE paper for two-dimensional characterization of TMR angular
% sensors. The sensor characterized for both bridges a cosinus and sinus
% bridge. The bridges have a phisically phase shift of 90° so the sensor as able
% to reference a superimposed magnetic field flud in x- and y-direction. The
% field was generated by an cross coil setup.
%
% *The resulting AMR characterization field abstracts a full rotation for
% cosinus and sinus output voltages by representing two maximum and minimun areas
% in the characterization fields. So circular path on the charctiration fields
% generates two sinoid periods related on current angle position between 0° and
% 180° or 180° and 360°.*

%% Magnetic Stimulus
% The right stimulus is the keynote for characterization records. It needs to
% have the abillity record slow enough for quasi static recordings but is not
% allowed to be real static so the magnetic field is not interrupted during the
% recording. Therefore slow sinoid carrier functions with even slower amplitude
% modulation is choosen to provide a quasi static stimulus. 
%
% The carrier function for the Hx-field stimulus is related to the cosinus
% bridge and so:
%
% $$c_1(t) = cos(\phi(t))$$
%
% Due to the physically phase shift the Hy-field stimulus is related to sinus:
%
% $$c_2(t) = sin(\phi(t))$$
%
% Both carrier runs with same carrier frequency:
%
% $$f_c = 3.2 Hz$$
%
% so they are executed with the phase vector over time:
%
% $$\phi(t) = 2\pi f_c t$$
%
% The carrier functions are triangle modulated to generate rising and falling
% amplituded. The modulation frequency is  set to:
%
% $$f_m = 0.01Hz$$
%
% Which generates a stimulus with 320 periods where 160 periods feeds a rising
% and falling record each multiplied with maximum fieldstrength amplitude:
%
% $$m(t) = H_{max} \cdot tri(t) = H_{max} \cdot tri(2(t-t_0)f_m)$$
%
% $$t_0 = \frac{1}{2f_m}$$
% 
% So the Hx- and Hy-field stimulus is described by:
%
% $$H_x(t) = m(t) \cdot c_1(t)$$
%
% $$H_y(t) = m(t) \cdot c_1(t)$$
%
% The stimulus amplitude depending on the phase in polar coordinates can be
% displayed for both parts by:
%
% $$H_{x,y}(\phi) = |H_{x,y}(\phi)| \cdot e^{j\phi} = m(t) \cdot e^{j\phi(t)}$$
%
% Where a rising spiral runs from center outwards for:
%
% $$0 < t < t_0$$
%
% And a falling spiral of amplitudes from outwards to center for:
%
% $$t_0 < t < \frac{1}{f_m}$$

%% Cosinuns Bridge Output
% The record characterization raw data are one dimensional time discrete
% vecotrs. To fieldstrength images like down below the recorded data must
% be referenced backwords to driven stimulus of Hx- and Hy-direction. But
% at first the image size of must be determined. Here fix size is set to
% 256px for each direction. So it spans a vector for Hx- and Hy-direction
% from minimum -25kA/m to maximum 25kA/m in 256 steps with a resolution of
% 0.1961kA/m. So it results into a 256x256 image. Now it runs for each
% point on the Hx- and Hy-axes and get the record index of the stimulus as
% backreference to the recorded bridge signal and sets the pixel. 
% That runs for the rising modulation amplitude and falling amplitude until
% every pixel is hit and ended up into a dimensional function image as:
%
% $$V_{cos}(H_x, H_y) = [mV/V]$$
% 
% The information of the image is build up in row. Reference Hx for
% constant Hy in each row. The method is also comparable to a
% historgram of Hx matches in the recorded sensor signal for one constant
% Hy and so on next historgram append on the next row for the next Hy.

%
%
%% Sinus Bridge Output
% The sinus characterization field is build up similar to the cosinus
% images but the information lays now in the columns so the data is
% collected in each column for a constant Hx and variable Hy:
%
% $$V_{sin}(H_x, H_y) = [mV/V]$$

%
%
%% Operating Point
% To determine an operating point in sensor array simulation the
% characterization fields needs some further investigation in static Hy and
% variable Hx field strength for cosinus bridge and vice versa for sinus bridge
% references. In compare to the TDK TMR the NXP AMR sensor has clear linear
% plateu. It has a continous non-linear areas divided in two maximum and minum
% areas. The best results for bridge outputs is supported by an operating point
% in saturation of the characterization fields so circular path on the fields
% should be described at 20 kA/m to 25 kA/m path radius.
