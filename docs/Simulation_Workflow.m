%% Simulation Workflow
% That workflow describes a best practice way to simulate a sensor array with
% dipole (spherical magnet).
%
% # Clean up old simuation datasets and plots of by executing
%   deleteSimulationDatasets and deleteSimulationPlots.
% # Edit generateConfigMat to needed specifications for simulation and generate
%   or regenerate config.mat by executing the script.
% # Execute generateSimulationDatasets to generate configure training and test
%   datasets.
% # Execute the needed plots to describe the simulation as wished.
% # Execute other parts of the software to work with current setup of simualtion
%   datasets.
% # Rename plots or move them to a subfolder to save them.
% # Move or rename Datasets if it is needed to keep them after done work.
% # Restart workflow for a next configuration to investigate on.
