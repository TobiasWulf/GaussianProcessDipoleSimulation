%% Workflows
% Developing software needs conventions to produce common results and good
% working software. There are certain points which matches good written
% software:
%
% # The reuse factor of the wirtten souce code.
% # Good source code structure or hierachy to expand.
% # Testing with aprobat frameworks e.g. Unittest.
% # Source code versioning.
% # Source code readability and detailed commenting and documentation
%
% The last point can be split into two points but Matlab provides a publish
% porcess with in source code comments can be used for documentation. What is
% probably not detailed enough and needs further documents in completition.
% Ongoing on that to provide support in guidance for current or
% upcoming project work it is recommended to declare common workflows for those
% points.
