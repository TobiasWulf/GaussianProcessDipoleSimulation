%% Source Code
% The project source code is clustered in modules where every subdirectory
% represents one certain module. Each module gathers functions and classes which
% are related to module specific themes or task fields. So the basic structured
% source code is located here. The combination of module functionality takes
% place in executable area of the project. So use the functions and classes in
% scripts and further on compiled binaries. Do not write bare executable source
% code here. For reproducable results and source code tracebillity each module
% has its own documentation entry where all underlaying functions and classses
% are listed. The best practice to develop new source code or modules is to do
% it in test driven way. This means write a test m-file for every new function
% or class m-file and test the functionality of the source code with assertion.
% This test driven development is called unittest and provides in combination
% with detailed documentation a high percentage of reusable source code.

%% Util Functions and Classes
% Util function and classes to provide reuse for often upcommings tasks and
% functionality besides project kernel and module source code. Located under
% source code directory: *./src/util*.
