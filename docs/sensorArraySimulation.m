%% sensorArraySimulation
% A spherical magnet is assumed to be used for stimulation of the sensor array.
% The far field of a spherical magnet can be approximately described by the
% magnetic field of a magnetic dipole. The magnetization of the sphere is
% assumed to be in y direction and the magnetic moment in rest position for 0Â°
% points in x direction. The magnet must be defined in a way that its field
% lines or field strengths own gradients sufficiently strong enough in the
% distance to the sensor array and so the rotation of the magnet generates a
% small scattering of the bridge outputs in the individual sensor points in the
% array. That  all sensors in the array approximately perceive the same magnetic
% field gradients of the current rotation step and the sensors in the array run
% through approximately  equal circular paths in the characterization field.
% This means the sperical magnet is characterized by a favorable mating of
% sphere radius and a certain distance in rest position in which a sufficiently
% high field strength takes effect. Here are neglected small necessary distances
% which are demanded in standard automotive applications. The focus here is on
% to generate simulation datasets, which are uniform and valid for angle
% detection. The modelling of suitable small magnets is not taking place of
% the work.
%
% A good working magnet is found emperical for H-field magnitudes of 200 kA/m
% and a distance from surface of 1 mm. See below figure of used magnet.
%
% To change settings for simulation edit the config script and rerun it. To
% generate trainging and test data set use simulation script. It generates
% dataset for all position are known to TrainingOptions and TestOptions in
% config. Generate a set of dataset for one evaluation case. Evaluate datasets,
% save results for later clustering, edit config for next use case and rerun
% simulation.
%
% The simulation bases on TDK TAS2141 "Rise" chracterization field. It has
% the widest linear plateau for corresponding Hx and Hy field strengths.
